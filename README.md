Wisp is an open-source, cross-platform, embeddable web framework for building small, lightweight
applications. It does not depend on any part of the ASP.NET Core SDK, runs on any platform supported
by .NET Core and works with any .NET language. It's specifically designed for embedding in existing
applications so it's fully self-contained and has no special environment requirements.
